This repository contains a custom Git commit-msg hook script that enforces a standardized commit message format. The script ensures that commit messages follow the pattern <type>:<description> (max 50 characters) and that there is a space between <type> and <description>. It also provides a list of available commit types: feature, fix, refactor, and wip, along with their descriptions for better project organization and clarity.
